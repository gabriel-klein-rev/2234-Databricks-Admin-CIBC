# Databricks CI/CD with Azure DevOps

## Introduction to CI/CD Principles
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) are modern software engineering practices that improve code quality, reduce manual effort, and ensure faster and more reliable releases. In the context of Databricks, CI/CD ensures that notebooks, jobs, workflows, and data pipelines are version-controlled, tested, and deployed consistently across development, staging, and production environments.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Developers regularly commit code to a shared repository.
  - Automated processes run unit tests, linting, and validation of Databricks notebooks or scripts.
  - CI ensures early detection of errors and enforces coding standards.

- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):**
  - Artifacts (such as Python packages, notebooks, or job definitions) are promoted to higher environments through automated pipelines.
  - CD ensures consistent releases to staging and production, with environment-specific configuration management.

- **Benefits of CI/CD in Databricks:**
  - Ensures reproducibility of pipelines and jobs.
  - Reduces manual errors during deployments.
  - Enhances collaboration among teams through version control integration.
  - Enables faster innovation cycles while maintaining quality.

## Setting up Azure DevOps for Databricks
Azure DevOps provides the infrastructure to manage CI/CD pipelines for Databricks projects.

- **Project Structure:**
  - Create an **Azure DevOps Project** within an organization.
  - Set up repositories for managing Databricks notebooks, libraries, and configuration files.
  - Define pipelines (YAML-based or classic) for build and release stages.

- **Authentication & Integration:**
  - Configure a **Service Principal** for secure authentication between Azure DevOps and Databricks.
  - Store authentication tokens or secrets in **Azure Key Vault** or **Azure DevOps Library**.
  - Use the **Databricks CLI** or **REST APIs** to connect and manage deployments.

- **Pipeline Resources:**
  - **Build Pipeline:** Validates, packages, and produces artifacts (e.g., Python wheel, validated notebooks).
  - **Release Pipeline:** Deploys these artifacts to Databricks environments (dev, staging, prod).

- **Environment Strategy:**
  - Use separate Databricks workspaces or Unity Catalog catalogs for dev, staging, and prod.
  - Manage environment-specific variables such as database names, storage paths, and cluster configurations.

## Databricks Notebooks CI/CD
Databricks notebooks are commonly used for data processing, ML experiments, and pipeline orchestration.

- **Version Control:**
  - Store notebooks in a Git repository (Azure Repos or GitHub integrated with DevOps).

- **Build Process:**
  - Validate syntax and enforce coding standards with automated checks.
  - Package reusable logic into Python modules or wheels for deployment across environments.
  - Use **Databricks Repos** to synchronize source control with workspace notebooks.

- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy notebooks automatically using Azure DevOps pipelines and the Databricks CLI or Asset Bundles.
  - Ensure that only validated and approved notebooks are deployed to staging/production.

## Databricks Jobs and Workflows Deployment
Jobs and workflows are the backbone of operationalizing Databricks pipelines.

- **Jobs Deployment:**
  - Jobs can be defined as JSON or YAML specifications stored in source control.
  - Deployment pipelines use the Databricks CLI or APIs to create/update jobs in target environments.
  - Jobs reference clusters (shared or job-specific), notebooks, or JARs/wheels.

- **Workflows (Multi-task Jobs):**
  - Define dependencies between tasks for orchestrating pipelines.
  - Store workflow definitions in source control to ensure reproducibility.
  - Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines so that changes to workflows are version-controlled and consistently updated.

- **Environment Management:**
  - Ensure jobs reference the correct environment variables, data sources, and clusters depending on the deployment stage.

## Automated Testing and Validation
Automated testing ensures code quality and correctness across environments.

- **Testing Levels:**
  - **Unit Tests:** Validate Python modules or notebook functions in isolation (run in CI pipeline).
  - **Integration Tests:** Validate jobs or workflows against small test datasets in a Databricks dev environment.
  - **End-to-End Tests:** Execute full pipeline runs in staging before promoting to production.

- **Validation Techniques:**
  - Schema validation of input/output tables.
  - Data quality checks (e.g., null counts, distribution checks, primary key uniqueness).
  - Runtime validation: ensuring jobs complete successfully without unexpected errors.

- **Automation in Pipelines:**
  - CI pipeline triggers unit tests on every commit/PR.
  - Release pipeline runs integration and end-to-end tests before promoting artifacts to higher environments.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep tests fast and lightweight in CI; deeper tests in staging releases.
  - Fail pipelines immediately if validation checks fail to prevent bad deployments.
  - Log test results and retain artifacts for traceability.
