# Spark Activity

## Goal
- Practice working with Spark Dataframes

## Steps
- Download the following csv files and load them into Spark Dataframes:
    - rental.csv
    - payment.csv
    - inventory.csv
    - film.csv
    - customer.csv

- Using dataframe transformations, answer the following questions. Be sure to record the transformations you used for review purposes.
    - Who are the top 5 customers for our movie rental store?
    - What are the top 5 movies that produce the most revenue for our store?
    - Based on our current inventory of films and the rentals that we get, should we modify our inventory at all? How so?

## Review
- We will review later.
